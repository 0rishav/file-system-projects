# File System Projects

## Goal
This repository is designed for developers of all experience levels, whether you're a fresher or an experienced professional. By working through these 50 file system projects using Node.js, you will not only master the fundamental file operations but also develop skills that align with those of a senior developer. For freshers, these projects will help you understand and implement core file handling techniques, while experienced developers will deepen their expertise and discover advanced methods. Whether you're just starting or already a senior developer, these projects will make you proficient in Node.js file system operations and improve your overall coding abilities.

Looking ahead, the next repository will focus on Buffers in Node.js, where you will gain a deep understanding of how to efficiently handle binary data and work with buffers in various real-world scenarios.
